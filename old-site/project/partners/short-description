<p><span>The</span> <a href="http://www.cnrs.fr">Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)</a>, <span>is the main French public research institution under the responsibility of the French Ministry of Education and Research. CNRS acts here in the name of the</span> <a href="http://www.ipsl.fr">Institut Pierre Simon Laplace (IPSL)</a>, </p>
<p>which is a federal institute located in Paris and composed of 9 research laboratories working on global environmental and climate studies. IPSL gathers about 1000 scientists and represents more than a third of the French research potential in atmospheric and oceanic sciences. Laboratories from IPSL involved in IS-ENES3 are Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l'Environnement (LSCE), Laboratoire d’Océanographie et du Climat (LOCEAN), Laboratoire Atmosphère, Milieux, Observations Spatiales (LATMOS), the IPSL federative unit as well as personnel from the joint unit Ecce Terra (UMS Ecce Terra) working within IPSL. One of the main objectives of IPSL is to understand climate variability and change, from both natural and anthropogenic origin, at global and regional scales.</p>
<p>Climate modelling relies on the development of the IPSL Earth system model, which participates to the WCRP CMIP international experiments. IPSL has coordinated the IS-ENES phases 1 and 2 projects, and is involved in several European projects such as ESiWACE and CRESCENDO. CNRS was a pioneer in developing since the 1980s a numerical model of the global physical ocean taking into account the HPC issues from the very beginning. This led to the NEMO Consortium involving different research/operational oceanography centres in Europe, which join efforts for the sustainable development of NEMO (www.nemoocean.eu). IPSL has expertise on data and metadata and is strongly involved in the development of the international ESGF and ESDOC. CNRS with the Commissariat à l’Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives (CEA) have developed XIOS, a software library dedicated to efficient IO management for climate models.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><a class="external-link" href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk">The Met Office</a> is the UK National Meteorological Service (NMS) and is one of the world's leading providers of climate and weather-related service. The Met Office was formed in 1854 with the primary aim to research the possibilities of forecasting the weather, mainly to protect the safety of ships and their crew at sea. As well as being the first NMS, the Met Office has continued to lead the field in the development of weather and climate services. The Met Office provides essential services 24/7, 365 days a year, in many aspects of business, social and political life in the UK.</p>
<p>The Met Office is a Trading Fund within the Department for Business Innovation and Skills, operating on a commercial basis under set targets. We are recognised as one of the world's most accurate forecasters, using more than 10 million weather observations a day, an advanced atmospheric model and a high performance super-computer to create 3,000 tailored forecasts and briefings a day. These are delivered to a huge range of customers from the Government, to businesses, the general public, armed forces, and other organisations.</p>
<p>This includes the Public Weather Service (PWS), which provides forecasts for the public to help them make informed decisions about their day-to-day activities. The National Severe Weather Warning Service is also a part of this, providing advance notice of weather which could affect public safety.</p>
<p>The Met Office provides the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme which is supported by Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy (BEIS), and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). Their investment provides the core science on which Government can make decisions to help the UK become resilient to climate variability and change, benefit from opportunities for growth, and engage in international climate negotiations. For example, research findings from the programme help ensure cost-effective deployment of renewable energy, and a resilient future for the nation's infrastructure. To achieve this, the Hadley Centre needs a large production facility to run complex multi-model integrations and ensembles of integrations as well as a resource for research and development. These models can run over periods of months and are time critical to meet deadlines for the customer and for the International Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) producing significant output that needs analysis over long periods of time.</p>
<p>The Met Office has a long experience in developing successful software infrastructures to support both Weather and Climate scientists and models including archive systems, user interfaces, build and configuration management systems.</p>

The primary mission of the laboratories is to facilitate national research capability in ways which complement and support the university research base. CEDA situated in the RAL Space department, provides environmental data services for another UKRI research council: The two teams from UKRI involved in IS-ENES3 are in the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA) division and the High Performance Software Engineering Group. Both these teams are in the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), one of seven research councils in UKRI. The services are divided between the environmental data archive and the JASMIN high performance data analysis facility. CEDA works closely with University research scientists, particularly with the researchers of the National Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, and with the UK Met Office, to maintain a comprehensive archive and an extensive range of services. In the last 5 years the JASMIN facility has transformed the use and exploitation of climate data in the UK. At the end of 2017, the facility hosts 6Pb of CEDA archive data on high speed disk and also provides a further 14Pb for use by users, who have access to substantial computing resources enabling flexible processing of the archive and their own data products. The start of 2018 will see the total capacity expanded to 44Pb. The current archive includes large volumes of both climate model simulations and satellite observations, as well as thousands of smaller data collections. A substantial expansion of the facility is under way, which will make it possible to allocate an additional 5Pb of disk for the CMIP6 archive. The High Performance Software Engineering Group is located in the Hartree centre.</p>
