Dr Hewitson, along with others in the team, has developed a statistical downscaling method (SOMD) and produced statistically downscaled projections for Africa and Asia. These projections have been extremely well received by the end user community through a large number of engagements and collaborative research projects. CSAG also serves as the lead organisation for the CORDEX Africa project and brings significant experience in both dynamical modelling and statistical downscaling over Africa. Over the past 6 years CSAG has developed a strong science society interface initiative. A critical component of this initiative is the Climate Information Portal (CIP) that has been developed to deliver CMIP3 and CMIP3 statistically downscaled projections to end users through a web based, guidance text rich, interface. User experience labs involving a variety of adaptation specialists have provided critical feedback and development is ongoing with the dissemination of CORDEX based projections a primary focus of current development.</p>

<p>The Danish Climate Centre (DKC) at DMI involves about 40 scientists. The DKC has extensive experience in climate modelling. The DKC has been involved in many international research projects on global and regional climate modelling funded by EU, including GLIMPSE, PRUDENCE (as coordinator); ENSEMBLES, and Ice2Sea. The DKC maintains extensive archives of climate model output from the PRUDENCE and ENSEMBLES EU-projects and the CORDEX project under the WCRP. These archives are public and accessible through a simple web interface. These archives have been extensively used through several years by a large and diverse set of users dealing with climate change impacts at all scales and with economic consequences and damages. DMI intends to remain a central CORDEX archive and is working on linking this database with the software created to organize the CMIP5 global model archive.</p>

IC3 is organized in two units devoted to a) climate dynamics and impacts (UDIC) and b) climate prediction and regional climate (Climate Forecasting Unit, <a class="external-link" href="http://ic3cfu.wikispot.org">CFU</a>). There are also two laboratories focused on air composition measurements and communication. Currently, 43 people work at IC3. The CFU, which is the research unit involved in this proposal, undertakes research on the development and assessment of dynamical and statistical methods for the prediction of global and regional climate on time scales ranging from a few weeks to several years. The formulation of the predictions includes the development and implementation of techniques to statistically downscale, calibrate and combine dynamical ensemble and empirical forecasts to satisfy specific user needs in the framework of the development of a climate service. Making progress in dynamical global climate modelling with a focus on climate prediction is one of the main tasks of the CFU. This implies a substantial amount of resources devoted to technical developments in the context of the EC-Earth consortium, among which there is the Autosubmit package.
